# Home-Idea
Read Me Contructed from Scan copies of Hand dran home sketches , these outline idea and it's evolution
Core idea is Home is to live in it , not that I'm going stand in front home always and enjoy the view 
So Simpler Sober Classic Frontal view.
Imporatance is Home needs to functional , easier to maintain, comfortable to be in .
Light and Air flow are an important Aspect.


 # Front View 
 Front view leans towards Kerala Traditional Homes. It's not manadatory to have the exact same view , Home should be ease to maintain and comformtable to live in, I'm not going to stand in front keep staring at it 24/7

 To provide protection from Rain to windows and wall terrace is extended and chejja is constructed , alternate could be slanting roof of managalore tile . Merging it seamlessly with Terrace slab so that there's no gap for water to seep in is important.
